        <p><b>Provided with instructions to create a 'Save the Tigers' call to action poster: </b>
          I chose the colors for multiple reasons. First, orange is the color of the standard tiger that most people
          may think of
          when they hear it. Further research shows that warm colors (orange, red, etc) are associated with strong
          feelings, with
          orange eliciting responses of power and anger (MasterClass). While I did not want the actual image of the
          feline to be
          colored, the colors would elicit a response in the viewer. I also added a slight outline in the words ‘Save
          the’ in red
          so as bring attention to the words, but not take attention away from the rest of the image.</p>

        <p>For the palette type, I chose analogous because the colors balanced better and provides just enough
          difference in the
          colors to give an overall aesthetic without drawing eyes away from the main subject of the poster – the tiger.
